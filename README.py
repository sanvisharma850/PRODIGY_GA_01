🧠 GPT-2 Text Generator App
Built with Hugging Face Transformers + Streamlit | My First AI App!

Ever wanted to build your own ChatGPT-style app?
This is my first deep learning project where I wrapped GPT-2 into a smooth, beginner-friendly UI using Streamlit — no clutter, just pure text generation magic.

✨ Features
Generate human-like text from any custom prompt

Control output length and creativity (temperature, top-k, top-p)

Clean, responsive UI built with Streamlit

Powered by Hugging Face’s pretrained GPT-2

Fully local — no API keys or hidden costs

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python 3.11

Transformers (Hugging Face)

Streamlit

VS Code

Virtualenv

🚧 Why I Built This
I wanted to understand how GPT-2 really works — beyond just clicking buttons on ChatGPT. So I dove deep, broke stuff, fixed it, and came out with this working text generator.
It’s simple, fast, and all mine.
